# Tech Blog MVC Fun

## Purpose
For this challege, I wanted to create a full-stack blog site for the tech community. Anyone can use the website to view posts and comments. However, if a user wants to contribute to the site, they must first sign up. Their information is saved and a dashboard is created for them. The dashboard stores their posts, allows them to create posts, and allows for editing of posts. After five minutes of inactivity, the website will automatically log the user out of their account for security purposes.
